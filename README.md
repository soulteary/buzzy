# Buzzy

![](.github/logo.svg)

Buzzy is a fork of [Fizzy](https://fizzy.do/) — the Kanban tracking tool for issues and ideas by [37signals](https://37signals.com). This repository contains the Buzzy fork source code.


## Running your own Buzzy instance

If you want to run your own Buzzy instance, but don't need to change its code, you can use our pre-built Docker image.
You'll need access to a server on which you can run Docker, and you'll need to configure some options to customize your installation.

You can find the details of how to do a Docker-based deployment, or deploy with Kamal for more flexibility (including code changes), in our [deployment guide](docs/deployment.md).


## Development

You are welcome -- and encouraged -- to modify Buzzy to your liking.
Please see our [Development guide](../docs/development.md) for how to get Buzzy set up for local development.


## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please read our [style guide](STYLE.md) before submitting code.


## License

Buzzy is released under the [O'Saasy License](LICENSE.md).
